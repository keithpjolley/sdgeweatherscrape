# sdgeweatherscrape

Scrapes an observation from an SDGE weather station near you, if you are near an SDGE weather station.

As of the creation of this project all I'm doing is putting observations into an sqlite3 database.
The next step will be to graph the data.

My goals are to:
  A) Have a longer record of observations than I can get from SDGE.
  B) Be able to see the deltas in temp between the two sites I'm collecting.

'B' is the real driver here. I have a theory that the Wisecarver (WCV) site gets hotter earlier
and stays warmer longer during the evening.  The reason why is Wisecarver sits on the side
of the valley while Lawson Creek (LCK), as most creeks tend to be, is in the bottom of the valley.
Cold air pools in the bottom of the valley.

There's another weather station nearby that I will add soon too but it's not an SDGE station.
LCK is at the head of Lawson Creek. This other one is further down the valley so I'd expect the
delta to be more pronounced even though it's closer to WCV than LCK.
